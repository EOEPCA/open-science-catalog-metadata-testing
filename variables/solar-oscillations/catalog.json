  "description": "The surface of the sun oscillates in certain modes defined by the number\u00bfof latitudinal and longitudinal modal planes. The sun vibrates in\u00bfmultiple modes simultaneously, each mode typically having a different\u00bfamplitude. Observing the amplitudes of the various solar oscillation\u00bfmodes is a way to look inside the sun. A commonly observed phenomena is the\u00bf\"5-minute\" oscillation, but other periods have been observed from 10 to 160\u00bfminutes on the long period scale to about 10 seconds on the short period\u00bfscale. Also observed are so-called \"g-mode\" oscillations (internal gravity\u00bfwaves) generated by turbulent convection below the photosphere.\u00bfThese oscillations are the result of internal motions of the sun and their study is known as helioseismology.",
